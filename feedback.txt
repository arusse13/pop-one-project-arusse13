Project feedback and mark details

Correctness and adherence to specification:  30%  (out of 30%)

The code is correct and adheres to the specification

Completeness of code, tests, and commit history:  26%    (out of 30%)   

Commit history looks “healthy”. There are four failing tests a point subtracted for each

Coding style: 8%   (out of 10%) 

If you are going to invoke start() at the end of the script, you should wrap it in

If __name__ == “__main__”:
    start()

So that when you come to test your script it does not attempt to run your code.

Anything you do after raising an exception will never be evaluated. Such as what you have on line 112, 115, and 119

Extension:  24%     (out of 30%) 

Extension implemented and works. It would have been better if an opportunity was was given the player to save multiple files. Also saving as a musketeer and then loading the game as an enemy should not be allowed.
